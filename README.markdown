# dot-vim

**This is outdated** - my vim configuration has moved to https://github.com/hallettj/home.nix/tree/main/home-manager/features/neovim

This is my vim configuration.  It is managed with [homeshick][], which
creates symlinks from the appropriate locations in my home directory.
Installing dependencies, compiling, and other setup tasks are handled
using [Ansible][], which runs the steps listed in `init.yml`.
